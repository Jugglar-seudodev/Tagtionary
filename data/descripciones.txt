Bikini	"A bikini is a two-piece swimsuit for women, typically comprising a bra-like top and a panty-like bottom; however, the bottom can also be in the style of a bikini skirt or bikini shorts. Bikinis come in a wide range of styles, with most designed to reveal more of the body, especially around the midriff and cleavage. The key distinguishing feature of a bikini is that it prominently exposes the midriff, whereas other types of two-piece swimsuits may have a higher waistline and/or a top that extends further to cover the area. However, it's worth noting that most modern two-piece swimsuits are, in fact, bikinis. If only the bra portion of the bikini is worn, use bikini top only. Likewise, use bikini bottom only when only the panty portion is worn. If a character's bikini top and bottom don't match, use mismatched bikini. <h4>. Related tags h6.

Rash Guard	"A Rash Guard (sometimes called a Rash Vest, Rashie or Swim Shirt) is a type of athletic shirt worn for extra function and protection when surfing, snorkeling, jet skiing, or doing other watersports where you want more protection than a swimsuit, but don't really need a full wetsuit. Most rash guards have long sleeves and while some women's tops show midriff, most are regular shirt length. Of note, they are sometimes worn under a wetsuit or diving suit for added comfort. Because rash guards are made from tight clothes-fitting materials like spandex, nylon, polyester, or neoprene and are often sold as matching top/bottom sets, this can sometimes make them appear similar to a wetsuit or one-piece swimsuit at a glance when no midriff is visible. A clue to watch for is the horizontal line where the top-piece and bottom-piece come together/overlap. If there is no line clearly identifying top from bottom, assume the garment is a wetsuit instead. <h4>.

Not to be confused with the similar-looking bodice, which reaches up to or over the breasts and often has sleeves or arm holes. <h4>.

Sarashi	"A long, winding strip of cloth, usually thick cotton, wrapped tightly around the midriff up to the chest. Historically, samurai wore them under their kimono to resist injury. In anime series, particularly in classic older ones, a delinquent character will be seen wearing one under their coat or unbuttoned shirt. The wrapping was a visible cue as to their general level of bad-assery. In this form the sarashi is wound mostly around the abdomen. Alternatively, a tomboyish girl may wear one to bind and/or flatten her breasts, especially if she is trying to pass as male. This gradually evolved into what is nowadays the more common way of wearing a sarashi, which is in the style of a tube top; in this case, it wraps around only the chest area in a very nontraditional way, leaving the midriff bare (e.g. post #4296298, post #4076845, post #3616420, post #2644312). This sarashi style is especially seen on kendo girls and other fighters. <h4>.

Armored boots and capes can be expected, along with options like helmets, gauntlets, elbow pads, knee pads, shoulder pads, power suits, etc. Naturally, and ironically, less coverage usually means less protection from attack, so one would think that bikini armor has an inherent magic to apply the inverse relationship between coverage and protection.

It is commonly used in daily occasions (meeting and parting, when offering thanks or apologies). This greeting consists of a half-fist held in the palm of the other hand at stomach level, while bowing slightly to deeply depending on how much respect they want to convey. Note that for males, the right-hand makes the fist and the left hand is on top. For females, it's the opposite. At a funeral, the greeting is done on the other way around: right-hand on top for men and left-hand on top for women. Baoquan Li (抱拳礼) also know as Kung Fu Salute, Hold palm salute or Hold fist salute, is a common etiquette derived from (but not exclusive to) Chinese martial arts. It shows the humility and often widely used among the kung fu masters and students. This salute is generally characterized by an open left hand placed next to a closed right fist. The importance is that the fingers on the left hand should stay extended and not flexed to cover the right fist. <h4>. Examples <h5> !post #844620: Gongshou Li <h5> !post #2872432: Baoquan Li <h4>.

Serafuku	"The school uniform with a sailor collar|sailor-style collar worn by Japanese schoolgirls in middle school and high school. The standard uniform consists of a white blouse, a pleated skirt, and a red neckerchief, but there are as many variations as there are stars in the sky. Serafukus are commonly worn with a ribbon or bow in lieu of the traditional neckerchief. The line between neckerchief and bow is blurry, as the bows worn with serafukus often aren't actually dedicated bows or bowtie|bowties, but rather a neckerchief tied into a bow instead of its intended scarf-like shape. A serafuku always includes a skirt. If a sailor-style top is paired with shorts or another bottom, sailor shirt should be used instead. In fact, sailor suits with shorts are the older, original style: in the Victorian and Edwardian eras, they were used as boys' suits, from which then the girls' uniform with a skirt was derived. For colored serafuku tags, both the shirt and skirt must match in color to apply, but not the neckwear or sailor collar. Sailor dresses should not be tagged as serafuku. <h4>.

Sleeveless dresses, strapless dresses, and off-shoulder dresses are mutually exclusive to each other. <h4>. Examples <h5> !post #2221907 <h5> !post #7303941 <h5> !post #3267928 <h4>.

Tube Top	"A strapless garment consisting of a continuous band of fabric across the torso, with the neckline stopping at the character's chest. Length ranges from covering the entire torso to just covering the breasts, or part of them; the latter two cases can additionally qualify as a bandeau or crop top. Traditionally, the only support they provided was due to the stretchiness of the fabric. Tube tops do not have any attached sleeves, meaning that they leave the shoulders/arms and upper chest area bare. Called boob tube in British English. A tube top made of bandages is referred to as a sarashi. Tube tops are innately strapless, thus should not be tagged sleeveless. <h4>.Correct examples <h5> !post #7248894 <h5> !post #5386478 <h5> !post #7291818: Narrow length additionally makes it a bandeau <h5> !post #3622090: A bikini under clothes|bikini worn underneath a tube top <h5> !post #7491543: A tube top worn underneath suspenders <h4>.Incorrect examples <h5> !post #6610868: Off-shoulder clothes such as off-shoulder shirt <h5> !post #6445896: Held up by a halterneck <h5> !post #5248498: Held up by shoulder straps <h5> !post #5201509: Sleeveless <h5> !post #2871553: Strapless shirt <h5> !post #8061661 <h4>.

Campaign Hat	"A campaign hat (also campaign cover, drill instructor cover, drill sergeant hat, lemon squeezer, Montana Peak, Mountie hat, ranger hat, sergeant hat, Scouts hat and Smokey Bear) is a broad-brimmed felt or straw hat, with a high crown, pinched symmetrically at the four corners (the Montana crease). It is associated with the New Zealand Army, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the World War I ground forces of the United States Army, contemporary U.S. military drill instructors, US state police forces, park rangers (and from them, their logo-cartoon and mascot Smokey Bear), Boy Scouts, and others. Although the campaign hat is occasionally referred to as a Stetson, this is from its common manufacture in the late 19th century by that company. It should not be confused with the quite different Stetson hat type with a different brim and crease, commonly known as the cowboy hat, and which is more commonly meant by the term Stetson today. The campaign hat also should not be confused with a slouch hat. Several U.S. state police services (for example, the Utah Highway Patrol), and federal agencies (for example, the United States Border Patrol) wear campaign hats. These state troopers are responsible for state and interstate highway safety, and in this capacity are variously referred to in different states as State Police, Highway Patrol, State Patrol, and State Highway Patrol. So common is use of the campaign hat among state highway police that they are sometimes referred to as smokey bears or smokeys, after Smokey Bear the famous logo-character of the U.S. Forest Service. The only State Police agencies that do not employ the “smokey bear hat”, are the New York State Police, Connecticut State Police, New Jersey State Police, Texas Highway Patrol, Maryland State Police, New Mexico State Police, and the Michigan State Police. There is no direct association between the cartoon bear and the Highway Patrol; they both derive their hat styles ultimately from the U.S. Cavalry. Many other police agencies, including numerous county sheriffs' services including the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, use campaign hats. Some local police use it for particular duties or divisions; for example, officers of the Los Angeles Police Department's and Chicago Police Department's mounted units employ the hat, and deputy sheriffs assigned as cadre of the Cook County Sheriff's Boot Camp wear campaign hats."	campaign_hat	8554333	7761378

Tate Eboshi	"A tate-eboshi (立烏帽子, lit. standing eboshi cap) is a tall, straight hat worn by Japanese male aristocrats since the Heian Period:[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heian_period]. Afterwards, various types of eboshi were born, e.g. Kazaori eboshi (Samurai eboshi), Okina eboshi, etc. Tate eboshi is the best-known one. This headdress came about in the Heian period:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heian_period based on headgear known as a hashiha-kouburi (圭冠). Kanmuri are official hats worn in the imperial court and eboshi are casual headdresses worn by the nobility and it was also worn by the normal people. The Mikado never uses an eboshi. Danbooru currently does not distinguish eboshi from ancient Japanese kanmuri (冠). Physically, the kanmuri stands out thanks to the koji (巾子), a cylindrical shape that stands upright from the top of the headwear, and the ei (纓), string-shaped cloth which hangs down from the rear of the headwear towards the wearer's back. The Japanese at the time when kanmuri were still simple sack-like shapes had a topknot on their head. They wore kanmuri by putting the topknot through a tube and binding the root of the topknot wearing this sack and letting the rest of the string hang down their backs. The terms koji and ei, which were used even when the shape and quality of the kanmuri changed, serve as a reminder of this older form. Notably worn by Mononobe no Futo and Soga no Tojiko of the Touhou series. <h4>.

Bloomers	"A type of underwear constructed much like boxer shorts worn by women. Most bloomers, unlike boxers, are gathered at the bottom of the legs. Often bloomers will be decorated with ribbon or frills at the waist and legs. Contrast with buruma, an English to Japanese to English translation of bloomer, usually identifying an over-panty, or a public garment whose purpose is to cover the panty and crotch area while leaving the maximum maneuvering room. In Japanese they are sometimes translated as kabopan or pumpkin pants (see Soul Eater episode 40.) <h4>. See also <h5> buruma <h5> panties <h5> Tag Group:Attire"	bloomers	8587722	8587721
Buruma	"A type of underwear-like gym shorts, typically worn as part of a gym uniform with a gym shirt. Buruma is an English-to-Japanese-to-English transliteration of the word bloomer, usually identifying an over-panty or public garment, whose purpose is to cover the panty and crotch area while leaving the maximum maneuvering room. In real life, buruma are rarely part of a gym uniform these days since they're considered old-fashioned; however, they still show up in anime since they are fetishized by otaku. The buruma has become a feature internationally in women's track and field and other sports uniforms. Though the design and materials may be different, the racing buruma as they are known in Japan, serve the same purpose and have the same brief shape. Contrast with bloomers, which are a type of underwear constructed much like boxer shorts worn by women. <h4>.

Bike Shorts	"Tight, form-fitting athletic shorts composed of nylon and Spandex that reach about mid-thigh. The primary purposes of bike shorts are to compress muscles (particularly the groin and thighs), prevent chafing, help remove sweat, keep muscles warm, and keep male genitals in place. There are two similar appearing types of these, compression shorts and bike shorts. Both types may be used without underwear, depending on if they were designed to act as underwear. On Danbooru, the most common version depicted are compression shorts, which are used for a variety of sports and athletic activities. Compression shorts are similar to bike shorts, but aren't designed with biking in mind and thus lack things like padding to reduce discomfort from long rides. Compression shorts are sometimes used by some women to conceal their panties beneath their skirt, especially for those in women's sports where their uniform has a skirt, such as field hockey or lacrosse. In some places, these are known as spats for some reason. If you were searching for the Jazz Age footwear, go to spats (footwear). <h4>. Types <h5> Bib shorts <h4>.

Shorts Under Skirt	"A pair of shorts worn beneath a skirt or dress. This is is how girls' school uniforms in Japan nowadays are most commonly worn.

Wearing gym/sports shorts under skirts became popularized because it simplifies changing clothes between physical classes/activities, among other things. Despite this, pantyshot|pantyshots may still happen, due to panties under pantyhose|tights commonly being worn in lieu of shorts. Because of this, it's also becoming more and more common to see this reflected in anime and manga, being often depicted as the default among school girls in series with a grounded premise such as Hori-san to Miyamura-kun|Horimiya, Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san|Takagi-san, or Asobi Asobase.

The term nun is applicable to Catholics – both eastern and western traditions – Orthodox Christians, Anglicans, Lutherans, Jains, buddhist nun|Buddhists, and Taoists. Nuns can vary in appearance not just across each tradition, but within traditions as well; common subtypes of nuns across traditions include military nuns (or battle/combat/warrior nuns).

Traditional Nun	"A traditional nun's habit, specifically a traditional Christian style (Catholic, Orthodox, etc), as opposed to the fetishized, non-traditional nun habits typically seen in anime and fanart. It consists at most of a long dress|long dress (that's black) with long sleeves and a guimpe (that's white), and typically stars the distinctive nun headdress (consisting of a wimple/coif [that's white], headwear bandeau [that's white], and veil [that's black], though it has become increasingly optional for some since the 20th century), and may also include a tabard, underdress, and so on. The habit is typically white-on-black, with black the predominant color, but they can also be wholly white, or white-on-blue. Color can depend on the religious order which the nun is a part of. They can also be wholly black, which is the common choice for Orthodox nuns. The traditional habit can be accentuated with minor additions, but not so much that it detracts from the basics (ex. Sister Claire and Double (skullgirls)| as opposed to Specter (arknights)| and Index (toaru majutsu no index)|), and some degree of modesty must be adhered to (ex. not too tight-fitting, no shortened dresses, no cutouts, no openings where they wouldn't normally be, no side slits which reveal skin or undergarment, no overtly sexual depictions of certain undergarments, etc). <h4>.

Meiji Schoolgirl Uniform	"A traditional women's fashion ensemble from turn-of-the-century Japan. It typically consists of a kimono (often with simple decorative patterns), a hakama skirt worn over it at the waist, and high lace-up_boots|laced boots, sometimes with a hair bow. In the later years of the Meiji Era, the Japanese government began to encourage the establishment of women's junior high schools. Typical Japanese women's clothing at the time, however, was more showy and elaborate than modest or functional. As a result, this style quickly rose in popularity as a more practical alternative for women attending school. Even in the present day, it is traditional attire for women at some college graduation ceremonies, as seen here:[https://ganbaregenki.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/hakama2.jpg?w=640]. Despite the name of the tag, this is not explicitly worn by schoolgirls, and it is not restricted to depictions of the Meiji era (especially since the style remained popular into the Taisho era). Although this outfit looks quite similar to some types of traditional Japanese waitress attire, the two should not be confused with one another (Although Bashamichi|in some cases, it may be difficult). As a rule of thumb, if the girl in question is wearing tasuki or has rolled-up/pushed-up sleeves, then these may be indicators of a waitress uniform (as well as less-subtle signs such as name tags, menus, serving trays, etc.) <h4>.

China Dress	"A form-fitting, Chinese-themed dress that has side slits up (usually) both legs and a mandarin collar. The traditional China dress, more properly called a cheongsam (Cantonese) or qipao (Mandarin), was introduced in Qing-era China in the 1600s but did not evolve into its current form until the early 20th century. There are many styles, but it typically is a long, form-fitting dress with a mandarin collar, an asymmetric left-over-right opening, high-to-medium side slits, and embellished with Chinese pankou|frog fasteners on the lapel and the collar. It may have any variety of sleeves. In anime they are often stylized to be more revealing than the traditional dress, being either very short, or having very long side slits with a pelvic curtain that barely covers anything, or having cleavage cutout|cleavage or back cutouts. Don't use this tag for qipao-styled clothes that aren't dresses, such as shirts or vests. Use Chinese clothes instead. For example, Hong Meiling's default outfit is not a dress. There are various types of neckline in qipao. The most common type is the Shanghai-style neckline, which has an asymmetrical closure with frogs leading diagonally up to the collar. The Beijing-style collar is a simpler symmetrical design, with a frog closure directly beneath the collar. The Jiangnan style is similar to the Beijing style, but features a clothing cutout|hole right underneath the collar. <h4>.

Fengguan	"A type of traditional Chinese headgear for women. It was worn mainly by noblewomen during the Ming Dynasty for ceremonies or official occasions; it is also worn by brides during weddings¹.

Sometimes they are adorned with decorative wings - called diyi - instead of beads. <h4>. See also <h5> chinese clothes|Chinese clothes <h5> tag group:headwear <h4>.

Hanfu	"Historical styles of clothing worn by the Han Chinese. Most styles have a “y” shape collar, but there are also styles with a rounded collar. There are several styles that are at times mistaken for kimono (most notably ruqun). You can typically distinguish between them based on the hairstyle and headwear. Males' hair may be pulled back into a simple ponytail or bun or held by a coronet. Emperors or princes may wear mian guan. If nothing else, huadian (forehead mark), or the tuanshan|circular fan is an easy distinguishing mark. Hanfu differs from Qing dynasty|Qing era clothing. Hanfu specifically refers to clothing worn during dynasties wherein the ruling class was made up of the majority Chinese ethnic group, the Han. The Qing Dynasty was ruled by the Manchu clothes|Manchu ethnic minority. The frog button and mandarin collar style clothes, often simply refered to as Chinese clothes, are not Hanfu, as they are not Han clothing, but in fact Manchu. This goes too for other erhnic minority clothing in china, such as Miao clothes or Uygur clothes. These fall under the umbrella of chinese clothes, along with hanfu. <h4>. Types H5.

Karate Gi	"Karategi (空手着 or 空手衣) is the formal Japanese name for the traditional uniform used for Karate practice and competition. A karategi is somewhat similar to a judogi (柔道着 or 柔道衣, Judo uniform) as it shares a common origin; however, the material and cut of the uniform is generally much lighter and looser fitting. The heaviest of Karategi are only 0.5 kg (16 oz) compared to some judogi at 1 kg (35 oz). Because of the nature of Karate training which emphasizes striking, kicking and a more limited range of standing throws compared to Judo the karategi has evolved in a manner that maximizes mobility and speed without the extremely coarse and strong fabric required for grappling and throwing found in Judo. They are made from smooth cotton which may be brushed or ribbed for unrestricted movement and added comfort. Reinforced stitching is common, as to compensate for the stresses put on the gi. <h4>.

Noh Mask	"Japanese theater masks. Masks used in Noh (能) performances, a classical Japanese form of dance drama.

Noh masks are traditionally made from carved cypress wood, painted or lacquered. They are frequently affixed by means of a red silk tying cord. Noh mask designs tend to employ heavy emphasis of shadows in order to portray different emotions (which can be changed by angling the mask). Masks depicting human beings tend to reflect traditional medieval Japanese aesthetics (resembling characters from woodcut prints), having pale 'chubby' faces with well defined brows and cheek lines, plus prominent eyebrows. Masks depicting older humans tend to have extensive wrinkles and beards. Masks depicting supernatural entities tend to have large eyes and exaggerated expressions. They may also have horns, fangs and other nonhuman features. Gold paint is frequently used to (literally) highlight the otherworldly appearance of such entities. Noh masks are used to portray different characters when on stage, similar to Western makeup. An actor may, however, rapidly switch between different masks to fulfill different roles. <h4>.

Panty Mask	"Wearing panties on the face like a mask. This is a common comedic gag for characters portrayed as perverts (either canonically or in fan-based memes), or those that engage in underwear theft. Common culprits featuring this situation include Akemi Homura and Hentai Kamen and Kajou Ayame (as Blue Snow), who both feature this as part of their costumes. This is typically shown as the panties being wrapped around the whole of the head (see post #912795, post #1021602) with the crotch of the panties covering the mouth and nose of the wearer, the waistband around the top of the head and chin, and the wearer's ears protruding through the leg holes, securing the sides of the waist band. Other methods also exist, where the top of the waistband crosses below the wearer's eyes (see post #4082406, post #3944133). This form better evokes the form of a mouth mask and seems to have become more common in response to the coronavirus pandemic of 2020. Other variations can exist (e.g. post #3308317, post #1717051, post #65772). This tag is applicable so long as the face is largely involved, and the panties aren't simply worn on the top of the head like a hat, with the waistband around the forehead. Panties on head covers both cases, and is implicated by this tag. For the converse of this tag, where a mouth mask is worn over the crotch as if they were panties, use the tag mask panties. <h4>.

Chemise	"A chemise is essentially a camisole|camisole that ends past the waist. Usually worn as an undergarment. In modern usage, a chemise is generally a woman's garment that vaguely resembles the older shirts but is typically more delicate, and usually provocative. Most commonly the term refers to a loose-fitting, sleeveless undergarment or type of lingerie which is unfitted at the waist. It can also refer to a short, sleeveless dress that hangs straight from the shoulders and fits loosely at the waist. A chemise typically does not have any buttons or other fasteners and is put on by either dropping it over the head or stepping into it and lifting it up. As lingerie, a chemise is similar to a babydoll, which is also a short, loose-fitting, sleeveless garment. Typically, though, babydolls are more loose-fitting at the hips and are generally designed to more resemble a young girl's nightgown, although many modern styles have added various sexualizing features. <h4>.

Although it has generally declined in real life, it still has many followers and remains popular in various Japanese media, particularily the manga & anime industry. It has many diverse substyles, with some commonalities. Gyaru style typically involves styled and coloured hair, trendy and often sexy gyaru-style clothing (especially from the shops in the mall Shibuya 109), and heavy makeup, with a focus on false eyelashes, enlarging the eyes, contouring, and circle lenses. Additionally, many gyaru use the gyaru-moji (ギャル文字) style of typing and certain specialized slang (ギャル語). There are also certain common hobbies among gyaru: dancing Para Para was at one time a very popular activity in gyaru circles. Two common elements of gyaru looks, especially in anime and manga representations, are tanned skin (ganguro - especially for older or throwback styles) and bleached hair. However, not every gyaru has tanned skin or bleached hair, and not every character with tanned skin and bleached hair is a gyaru. In mainstream media, gyaru are usually depicted as either an energeric or an extroverted character, while adult media depicted either as a high-school student prostitution|prostitute or a character with unusually high sex drive.

Bara	"Bara (Gei komi':[https://www.fujoshi.info/geikomi] in Japan) is a Japanese genre of manga and art (usually) by and for gay and bisexual men. With heavy focus on the masculine features and appeal of mature male|men. While mostly dependent on an artist's personal tastes, the ‘bara’ archetype features 3 main body types: <h5> Bear-type bodies, (typically tagged as plump or fat), are generally softer and rounder looking, with varying degrees of visible musculature. - Artists: Suv (suv032)|, Kuro nezumi inu, Tevit (tevit15)|. <h5> Hunks/Jocks or muscular|Muscular-type bodies, in contrast to the chiseled v-taper | triangular look of professional bodybuilders, have defined musculature that is usually more proportional overall, similar to that of athletic strongman:[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongman], with a strongman waist | wider waist (comparison:[https://cdn.donmai.us/original/e8/4f/e84f5efad6fd9ef1ff268d1982a564d6.jpg]), though the more shredded muscle | chiseled appearance can be a stylistic choice (see Nikism for reference). - Artists: Tarutoru, Crow (siranui)|, Dopey (dopq)|. <h5> Twunk or otter-type bodies, tagged toned, or muscular (especially with younger or sometimes older mature males). - Artists: itto_(mentaiko)|Mentaiko, Homri, Torakichi (ebitendon)|, Kuroshinki. Musculature, when depicted, is typically more exaggerated for emphasis (e.g. pectorals|pecs) along with the bulge (implying an exaggerated penis size), and both are usually rather noticeable even when the subject is wearing clothes - abnormally so. When this exaggeration is paired with the points above, which assert a softer approach when drawing the male form, the 'bara' archetype becomes noticeable. Common masculine features on subjects include: different degrees of facial hair|facial and body hair (especially the navel hair|happy trail leading to male pubic hair|pubic hair) - or a complete absence of it in the case of younger characters (depending on the artist's tastes), thick eyebrows|thick, eyebrow cut|cut or forked eyebrows|bushy eyebrows, sideburns, buzz cut, large hands, scars, tattoos, bandaids, bandages, wrinkled skin|wrinkles (visible with mature male|mature and old man|old men), etc. All of these characteristics lend the style a degree of flexibility that allows for further stylization as well as broader cultural mixing between communities; for instance, despite bara’s roots in opposition to them, there is substantial cross-over with the larger yaoi|Boys' Love community - which can be seen in some artists' styles (E.g Yotti, Arima (arima_bn)|). It can also be applied to non-human and humanoid characters, such as furry males (E.g Wafu (youzora_samo18)|, Boogbogex). [expand= History and meaning] The word bara literally means rose in Japanese. The term originally comes from the magazine Barazoku:[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barazoku], Japan's first gay men's magazine, with the term traditionally referring to more bishounen-esque men. As a result, the word bara also began being used as a slang term for any male homoerotic works in general (similar to the use of yaoi in the West). The word bara as used here is primarily Western, stemming more from its application on art more commonly known as gei komi, gei manga, or mens love in Japan, a practice that began on Japanese imageboards, where they intentionally misappropriated the term, this interpretation later being exported abroad. Whilst some Japanese gei komi creators oppose the usage of bara due to its earlier legacy, others have embraced it. Note that, like most Manga Demographics, bara is commonly defined in terms of the target audience, not the authors or the subject matter. Bara conceptually often contrasts with yaoi, which is gay male media traditionally made by heterosexual women to appeal to other heterosexual women. Whereas bara is gay/bi male media made by gay/bi men for gay/bi men, that generally features romantic and sexual relationships between muscular mature male|mature men and realistic(ish) relationships, often including LGBTQ issues, yaoi generally features androgynous, idealized, effeminate characters and melodramatic plots devoid of LGBTQ issues (like most yuri, for similar root reasons). By its nature, it is also heteronormative, whether by stereotypically depicting overly emotional relationships or using concepts such as uke and seme, and includes themes of homosociality, which contributed more to the clash between fans of the two genres, though nowadays there's a grey area between the two. What they share in common the most though is the fact that non-Japanese audiences have misappropriated them, with yaoi having become a generalized weeb term for anything involving gay men.  <h4>.

Bishounen	"A Japanese term literally meaning beautiful teenage boy. The equivalent English concept is pretty boy. The term describes an aesthetic that can be found in disparate areas in Asia: a teenage boy, around 13 to 18 years old, whose beauty (and sexual appeal) transcends the boundary of gender or sexual orientation. Bishounen characters are fairly common in manga and anime; a heavy number of male characters show subtle signs of the bishounen style, such as slender eyes or a feminine face. <h5> !post #3331027 <h5> !post #4151953 <h5> !post #5566960 <h5> !post #5965649 Bishounen are usually drawn delicately, with long limbs, silky or flowing hair, and slender eyes with long eyelashes that can sometimes extend beyond the face. It's best to tag images that focus on the character's beauty, so there tends to be a heavier emphasis on solo or duo images here. Group images are fine, so long as the majority of the males exemplify this trait. As the name suggests, the term is best used when you can still tell that the character is a male. If there are remarkable feminine traits, consider adding androgynous. For characters where their feminine traits are at the point of making you believe that they're a female, use otoko no ko instead. Note that with genderswap (ftm)|female-to-male genderswaps, this tag can apply if they possess the above-mentioned traits. In English-speaking circles, bishounen is used somewhat more loosely than it is in Japan, effectively used for any male character with pseudo androgynous beauty, regardless of whether they are shounen or not (so variants covering those older than 18, ala biseinen, bichuunen, and bidanshi, find themselves incorporated, as well as those younger than 13)."	Bishounen	8586276	8583339
Otoko No Ko	"A male character who looks or acts feminine, often passing as female. The Japanese term otoko no ko is a pun on 男の子 (otoko no ko), meaning boy, replacing 子 with the ko reading of 娘 (commonly musume, girl). Otoko no ko characters are sometimes called traps or femboys in English-speaking communities. These terms have been deprecated in some areas (including this site, which aliases both tag names to this one) due to use as anti-LGBT slurs. Some communities have mistakenly taken to using the term as a word for feminine boys no matter if they convincingly look like girls or not. If you can correctly tell the character is male with complete certainty from the thumbnail alone without looking at the genitalia, it's not this. While many otoko no ko engage in crossdressing, it is not a requirement. Sufficiently feminine characters can pass as girls even when near-nude or dressed in typically masculine clothing. <h4>.

Fujoshi	"Literally translated as rotten girl, the original meaning is basically a female fan of yaoi. The term is more recently being used simply to identify a female otaku, similar to how the western term fangirl has grown to be synonymous with girls who write slash fanfiction of their favored series. It should be noted that the concept of yumejoshi (an otaku girl that follows heterosexual girl-targeted works like Otome and Teen's Love) has also come into use, though it is much less infamous than its yaoi counterpart. While the term otaku could be used for males and females, fujoshi specifically identifies females. Male fans of yaoi are called fudanshi instead. The equivalent words for overzealous fans of yuri are himejoshi and himedanshi. <h4>.

Exhibitionism	"A fetish involving exposing one's body, either partially or entirely, or to commit sexual acts in public areas. The participant is almost always willing and often makes an overt effort to gain the attention of onlookers. While similar to (and often overlaps with) zenra, exhibitionism differs from zenra in the emphasis on exposing private parts or sexual arousal from being seen by others, whereas zenra involves nude people doing various activities, sexual or not, as if it were a normal occurence. This tag is applicable when: <h5> Character(s) is seen with exposed private parts and/or in nude in public places, willingly or not. <h5> Character(s) is seen committed sexual acts within the presence of other people or the crowd. <h5> Character(s) is overtly and actively exposing their nudity toward others (such as the viewer, etc.) or is aware of their state of nudity but does not attempt to cover it. <h5> Character(s) is wearing a clothes so revealing that it would exposes their private parts, especially in public places. Do not apply this tag simply because character is wearing revealing clothes, only apply when character is shown to be attempting to garner attention or are aware that other people saw them. This tag is not applicable when: <h5> Character(s) is not in a public place. Selfies and livestreams should not get tagged. <h5> Blank background. Use flashing for that. <h4>. See also h5.

Public Nudity	"Being mostly or completely nude in a public location, or in a situation where one might be seen by members of the public.

Use only if it is obviously a public location. <h4>. See also <h5> exhibitionism <h5> public indecency <h5> zenra"	public_nudity	8582620	8581070
Zenra	"A fetish in which public nudity and sexual acts is treated as a normal everyday activity. Zenra is a Japanese word, literally translated as completely nude. Zenra fetish features people (usually women) participating in everyday tasks that they might otherwise perform clothed, such as casual scenes with participants playing in an all-nude orchestra in a seemingly oblivious state of mind towards their nudity. Others incorporate the nudity on a more conscious level by doing such things as playing strip game|strip volleyball, where the participants must remove clothing each time the other team scores a point. While very similar to exhibitionism and nudist|nudism in concept and often overlaps with each other, zenra fetish can be distinguished by how the setting treated nudity and sexual activity, as zenra fetish treats nudity either as a social norm at best and a minor inconvenience at worst. In addition, some zenra works also further emphasize sexual elements of the character (such as character exposing their private parts) as another form of beauty standard. Please note that bathing or tanning on the beach are not zenra as that is normally done naked. <h4>.

Stealth Sex	"Discreetly engaging in any kind of sex act in the presence of other people, so as to prevent those people from realizing that the act is occurring. When this occurs in a public place, it may be a type of public indecency. Note that not all stealth sex takes place in public (e.g. post #1124080). This tag covers sexual activities other than sexual intercourse, so remember to also use the sex tag where applicable. Only use this tag for sex acts that involve two or more parties.

Cheating (Relationship)	"Cheating, in a sexual sense, is having sex with someone other than one's regular partner in a monogamous relationship. When this happens among married people, this is known as adultery. This can also apply to meeting another without the regular partner knowing. For the act of using dishonest means to win a competition or similar, see cheating_(competitive)|cheating (competitive). <h4>. Example <h5> !post #8098370 <h4>.

Netorare	"A fetish in which someone close to the protagonist is either willingly or unwillingly seduced and stolen away. This isn't necessarily limited to one's lover, but may also include friends, unrequited love interests, or even relatives. Closely related is netori/netoru (寝取り/寝取る). In this genre, the protagonist instead takes the lover of someone else. Also related is cuckolding, in which seeking out others is actively encouraged, even at the expense of the cuckold. Posts on Danbooru should include the presence of the cheated on in some form, physical or otherwise (such as on the phone, as is common), or mentioned at some significant length. Do not apply this tag if only the artist's commentary mentioned that it was NTR-themed posts but other sign of it being such shown in the image itself (such as the cuckholded character being absent). Not to be confused with cheating (relationship), which is when one party intentionally approached the third party without their partner's consent. <h4>.

Crossdressing	"Wearing clothing traditionally reserved for the opposite sex (e.g. men wearing dresses, women wearing tuxedos, etc.) This is distinct from otoko no ko, which specifically refers to a male convincingly dressed in female clothing. The crossdressing tag also handles both females in male clothing, and males in female clothing who aren't fooling anyone. Futanari and futa without pussy are considered to be crossdressing if they are wearing men's clothing. <h4>. Examples <h5> !post #6741963 <h5> !post #1787365 <h5> !post #727572 <h4>.

Reverse Trap	"Per otoko_no_ko|trap, a female character who looks and may or may not act masculine. Most likely also dresses like a male, although unlike mere crossdressing the character is assumed by others to be male until demonstrated otherwise. As a rule of thumb, if you can correctly tell the gender with complete certainty from the thumbnail alone, it's not a reverse trap. Often indicated on Pixiv by the 男装 (Dansou lit. masculine clothes/disguising oneself as a man) and 男装の麗人 (Dansou no Reijin lit. A beautiful woman disguised as a man) tags.

Futa Without Pussy	"Visually similar to futanari with penis and testicles but no pussy|vagina. That is to say, the character has a female body but male sex organs. This tag should be used if you can either visually confirm the character has no vagina or there is information that clearly supports that the character doesn't have one, such as the tags used in the source, the artist's commentary or indicators in the art itself that confirms the character is a newhalf. When in doubt use the futanari tag instead. On Danbooru, futa without pussy was previously referred to with the word newhalf. Newhalf is a Japanese slang word for a pre-op or non-op male-to-female trans person, also referred to as shemale (シーメール). The word newhalf was originally used for referring a male who had begun to transition to female but kept her lower body the same; literally a new half. Due to Danbooru's usage of the word not reflecting its real world usage, functionally using it more as a synonym for futa without pussy, the tag was renamed to use that instead. The fates of the related tags below that still use the newhalf name have yet to be decided. <h4>.
